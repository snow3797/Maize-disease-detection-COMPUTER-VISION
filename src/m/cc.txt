10.0 WORKPLAN 
Design and implementation of the Traffic infraction 
detection system web based interface 
Creating a detailed work plan for a traffic infraction detection system involves several stages 
including literature surveys, modeling, review, analysis, design, testing, reporting, and 
thesis/project writing.  
Work Plan for Traffic Infraction Detection System: 
1. Literature Surveys: 
❖ Conduct an extensive review of existing literature on traffic infraction detection, vehicle 
number plate recognition, object detection, and related areas 
2. Modeling and Algorithm Design: 
❖ Select appropriate algorithms for traffic infraction detection and vehicle number plate 
recognition. 
3. Implementation : 
❖ Implement the designed system and algorithms using Python and OpenCV. 
4. Testing : 
❖ Conduct rigorous testing to evaluate the system's performance, accuracy, and efficiency. 
❖ Address any identified issues or bugs. 
5. Deploy the system : 
❖ This is the stage where the system if ready to be used and to evaluate its performance. This 
can be done manually reviewing the detection results or using metrics such as accuracy, 
precision and recall.  
6. Documentation: 
❖ Write chapters for the preject, including introduction, literature review, methodology, 
implementation details, results, discussion, and conclusion.
